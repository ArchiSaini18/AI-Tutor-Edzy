# **AI Tutor for CBSE Class 9 – Linear Equations in One Variable**

## Subject & Class
- **Subject:** Mathematics  
- **Class:** CBSE Class 9  
- **Topic:** Linear Equations in One Variable  
- **Syllabus Alignment:** NCERT Class 9 Mathematics

## Overview
This project proposes an AI-powered tutor designed to help Class 9 CBSE students understand and practice
Linear Equations in One Variable. The tutor acts as a supportive, judgment-free learning companion that
focuses on conceptual clarity rather than rote memorization.

The AI tutor explains *why* each step works, encourages logical thinking, and builds student confidence.

  - Errors with brackets and division
  - Skipping verification steps
  - Low confidence in mathematics

## Key Features
- Simple explanations using balance-scale analogy
- Indian real-life examples
- Socratic questioning instead of direct answers
- Unlimited NCERT-style practice questions
- Adaptive difficulty and pacing
- Encouraging and non-judgmental feedback

## Learning Context
