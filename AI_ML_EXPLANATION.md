# AI / ML Explanation

----

## Core Technology
- Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explanations, hints, and questions
- Prompt engineering ensures:
  - NCERT alignment
  - Safe and supportive tone
  - Step-by-step reasoning

----

## Optional Architecture
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used
- NCERT textbook content can act as a grounding source
- Prevents hallucinations and off-syllabus content

----

## Personalization Logic
The AI adapts responses based on:
- Student answers (correct / incorrect)
- Repeated mistake patterns
- Language indicating frustration or confidence

----

### Adaptation Examples
- Slower pace after repeated errors
- More examples if confusion persists
- Increased challenge after consistent success

----

## Safety & Accuracy
- No collection of personal data
- No competitive exam or cheating guidance
- Strict adherence to Class 9 NCERT syllabus
- Encouraging emotional tone

----

## Evaluation Metrics
- Reduction in common mistakes
- Improved student confidence
- Higher engagement levels
- Ability to solve problems independently

----

## Learning Flow
Student Input → Prompt Selection → LLM Response → Safety & Accuracy Check → Feedback → Improvement Loop

-----
## Summary
This AI Tutor demonstrates responsible and effective use of LLMs in education by combining
conceptual learning, personalization, emotional support, and syllabus safety.
